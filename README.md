 STAT545 Homework 8
## Zachary Sherker

This is a repository for Zachary Sherker's STAT545 hw 8.

## In this assignment, I will:

Add three features to the BC liquor store shiny app, inlcuding:
1) a description of the app
2) the option to select multiple types of liquor when filtering
3) the option to sort search results by price

This app allows you to search products sold at BC liquor stores and provides data such as country of origin, price, wine sweetness, and alcohol content.
